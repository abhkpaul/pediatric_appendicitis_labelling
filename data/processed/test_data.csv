penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. We place two additional trocars, one in the suprapubic region and
one in the left lower quadrant, both under direct vision. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon
entering the abdominal cavity, minimal adhesions noted. Appendix appeared perforated, surrounded by mild
inflammatory reaction. There was a contained abscess in the right lower quadrant. The omentum was wrapped around
the inflamed appendix. The appendix is mobilized using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection. The mesoappendix
is divided using a bipolar energy device. We secure the appendiceal base with two Endoloops and transect between
them. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Saline is used for thorough irrigation of all quadrants. Umbilical

Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with caudal block administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. Direct trocar insertion after skin and fascia incision. Additional 5 mm trocars are placed in the
right and left lower quadrants under laparoscopic guidance. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement.
Upon entering the abdominal cavity, extensive adhesions noted. Appendix was shrunken and surrounded by A
moderate amount of purulent material was present in the pelvis. and Mild adhesions between bowel loops observed. No
evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Dissection is carried out to isolate the base of the appendix. We dissect the
mesentery of the appendix and use the electrocautery to coagulate the artery. Absorbable ligatures are applied prior to
amputation. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Irrigation performed with antibiotic solution. We close the
fascia with Vicryl 2-0 in a interrupted fashion. Skin is approximated with non-absorbable Prolene 4-0.
Repeat CBC and CRP postoperatively. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.

prepped in sterile fashion. Direct trocar insertion after skin and fascia incision. Three trocars in total are used for
laparoscopic access. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity,
diffuse adhesions noted. Findings include distended appendix with intense inflammatory changes. Multiple small
abscesses were encountered. No abnormal adhesions found. Appendix is isolated after adhesiolysis. Appendiceal
vessels controlled with clips. We secure the appendiceal base with two Endoloops and transect between them.
Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. We irrigate the abdominal cavity copiously with warm saline until the
effluent is clear. The umbilical fascia is reapproximated with interrupted PDS 3-0 sutures. Skin incisions are closed with
interrupted nylon 4-0.
The patient will be continued on IV antibiotics and advanced to diet as tolerated. The patient tolerated the procedure well

ports are placed in the suprapubic area and left iliac fossa. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement.
Upon entering the abdominal cavity, diffuse adhesions noted. Operative findings included gangrenous appendix and
fluctuating inflammation. No abscess was identified. The omentum was wrapped around the inflamed appendix.
Meticulous dissection performed due to distorted anatomy. We dissect the mesentery of the appendix and use the
electrocautery to coagulate the artery. Endoscopic stapling is used for appendiceal division. Specimen placed in
EndoCatch bag for removal. We irrigate the abdominal cavity copiously with warm saline until the effluent is clear. We
close the fascia with Polysorb 2-0 in a interrupted fashion. Skin is approximated with Steri-Strips.
IV fluids and pain management as per protocol. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.

Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We make an infraumbilical incision of 1 cm, dissect the subcutaneous tissue bluntly and
penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. Additional 5 mm trocars are placed in the right and left lower
quadrants under laparoscopic guidance. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the
abdominal cavity, moderate adhesions noted. Intraoperative examination revealed friable appendix. Purulent fluid was
noted throughout the abdominal cavity. Severe adhesions required careful lysis. The surrounding tissues showed
fluctuating reaction. We proceed with careful dissection of the appendiceal attachments. Appendiceal vessels controlled
with clips. We secure the appendiceal base with two Endoloops and transect between them. Specimen placed in
EndoCatch bag for removal. We irrigate the abdominal cavity copiously with warm saline until the effluent is clear. The
umbilical fascia is reapproximated with interrupted Vicryl 2-0 sutures. Skin incisions are closed with non-absorbable
Prolene 4-0. Minor bleeding controlled with cautery.

Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with mask induction administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. Direct trocar insertion after skin and fascia incision. Supplementary ports are placed in the
suprapubic area and left iliac fossa. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the
abdominal cavity, diffuse adhesions noted. Operative findings included perforated appendix and fluctuating
inflammation. Abscess cavity found in RLQ and irrigated. Fibrinous adhesions were lysed during the procedure. We
proceed with careful dissection of the appendiceal attachments. The mesoappendix is divided using a bipolar energy
device. The appendix is ligated at its base with two absorbable sutures and then amputated. Specimen placed in
EndoCatch bag for removal. We lavage the abdomen extensively, paying particular attention to the pelvis and right
gutter. The umbilical fascia is reapproximated with interrupted Vicryl 2-0 sutures. Skin incisions are closed with
non-absorbable Prolene 4-0.
Discharge home when tolerating oral intake and afebrile. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood
loss.

additional trocars, one in the suprapubic region and one in the left lower quadrant, both under direct vision. No iatrogenic
injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, diffuse adhesions noted. Operative
findings included ruptured appendix and marked inflammation. A moderate amount of purulent material was present in
the pelvis. No significant adhesions. Ovaries and uterus normal in female patients. Blunt dissection is used to free the
appendix from surrounding structures. The appendiceal mesentery is carefully taken down with harmonic scalpel. We
apply an endoscopic stapler to the base of the appendix and divide it. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal.
Irrigation performed with antibiotic solution. We close the fascia with Ethibond 2-0 in a interrupted fashion. Skin is
approximated with interrupted silk 4-0.

Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with local infiltration administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We create a 1 cm infraumbilical incision and enter the abdomen using the Hasson technique.
Single-incision laparoscopic port is used. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the
abdominal cavity, significant adhesions noted. Operative findings included acutely inflamed appendix and extensive
inflammation. There was a contained abscess in the right lower quadrant. Fibrinous adhesions were lysed during the
procedure. Blunt dissection is used to free the appendix from surrounding structures. The mesoappendix is dissected
and the appendiceal artery is controlled with electrocautery. Endoscopic stapling is used for appendiceal division.
Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. We irrigate the abdominal cavity copiously with warm saline until the
effluent is clear. Umbilical port site is closed with Ethibond 2-0 and skin with interrupted nylon 4-0. No evidence of
malignancy.
Consult infectious disease if antibiotics need adjustment. Bladder and ureters visualized, no injury. The patient tolerated
the procedure well with minimal blood loss.

5 mm trocars are placed in the right and left lower quadrants under laparoscopic guidance. No iatrogenic injuries
occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, diffuse adhesions noted. Findings include
gangrenous appendix with persistent inflammatory changes. No pus or abscess formation found. Severe adhesions
required careful lysis. No bowel injury noted. The appendix is mobilized using a combination of sharp and blunt
dissection. We dissect the mesentery of the appendix and use the electrocautery to coagulate the artery. The appendix
is ligated at its base with two absorbable sutures and then amputated. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal.
We irrigate the abdominal cavity copiously with warm saline until the effluent is clear. We close the fascia at the
umbilical port with figure-of-eight sutures of Maxon 2-0 and the skin with Dermabond. Incidental Meckel's diverticulum
found and left in situ.

Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with nitrous oxide administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. Transverse infraumbilical incision is performed and access gained via blunt dissection. Three
trocars in total are used for laparoscopic access. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering
the abdominal cavity, minimal adhesions noted. The appendix was acutely inflamed with fluctuating inflammation. There
was a contained abscess in the right lower quadrant. The omentum was wrapped around the inflamed appendix.
Dissection is carried out to isolate the base of the appendix. The mesoappendix is dissected and the appendiceal artery
is controlled with electrocautery. Endoscopic stapling is used for appendiceal division. Specimen placed in EndoCatch
bag for removal. We irrigate the abdominal cavity copiously with warm saline until the effluent is clear. We close the
fascia at the umbilical port with figure-of-eight sutures of Polysorb 2-0 and the skin with subcuticular Vicryl 4-0.
Patient to receive postoperative IV antibiotics with monitoring for return of bowel function. Minimal intraoperative blood
loss. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.","ACUTE APPENDICITIS.

Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with caudal block administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We make an infraumbilical incision of 1 cm, dissect the subcutaneous tissue bluntly and
penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. Supplementary ports are placed in the suprapubic area and left
iliac fossa. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, diffuse
adhesions noted. The surgical field demonstrated necrotic appendix with severe surrounding inflammation. Abscess
cavity found in RLQ and irrigated. Multiple bowel loops adherent to the mass. We carefully dissect the inflammatory
mass and identify the ruptured appendix. Mesenteric vessels to the appendix are secured prior to removal. We secure

A 13-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain with vomiting. Initially evaluated 2 days prior and diagnosed with
pneumonia. Now has markedly elevated WBC, high CRP, no fever. Imaging: ultrasound suggestive of appendicitis.
Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with local infiltration administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We make an infraumbilical incision of 1 cm, dissect the subcutaneous tissue bluntly and
penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. Supplementary ports are placed in the suprapubic area and left
iliac fossa. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, significant
adhesions noted. The surgical field demonstrated suppurative appendix with intense surrounding inflammation. Multiple
small abscesses were encountered. No abnormal adhesions found. Patient tolerated procedure well. Dissection is
carried out to isolate the base of the appendix. The appendiceal mesentery is carefully taken down with harmonic
scalpel. We apply an endoscopic stapler to the base of the appendix and divide it. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag
for removal. We lavage the abdomen extensively, paying particular attention to the pelvis and right gutter. Fascial
closure is performed at the umbilical site using PDS 2-0. The skin is closed with Steri-Strips. No evidence of peritoneal
carcinomatosis.
The patient will be continued on IV antibiotics and advanced to diet as tolerated. The patient tolerated the procedure well
with minimal blood loss.",Normal,"A 13-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain with vomiting. Initially evaluated 2 days prior and diagnosed with

Imaging: CT scan showing appendiceal abscess.
Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We make an infraumbilical incision of 1 cm, dissect the subcutaneous tissue bluntly and
penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. Two working ports are established in the right and left lower
quadrants. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, minimal
adhesions noted. Findings include necrotic appendix with patchy inflammatory changes. There was a contained abscess
in the right lower quadrant. Severe adhesions required careful lysis. No evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Blunt
dissection is used to free the appendix from surrounding structures. The mesoappendix is divided using a bipolar energy
device. Endoscopic stapling is used for appendiceal division. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Saline is
used for thorough irrigation of all quadrants. We close the fascia at the umbilical port with figure-of-eight sutures of PDS
3-0 and the skin with subcuticular Monocryl 4-0.
Consult infectious disease if antibiotics need adjustment. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood
loss.

surgery. Imaging confirmed appendicitis.
Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with mask induction administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We make an infraumbilical incision of 1 cm, dissect the subcutaneous tissue bluntly and
penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. Supplementary ports are placed in the suprapubic area and left
iliac fossa. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, moderate
adhesions noted. The appendix was suppurative with mild inflammation. A moderate amount of purulent material was
present in the pelvis. No significant adhesions. No need for drains postoperatively. Meticulous dissection performed due
to distorted anatomy. We dissect the mesentery of the appendix and use the electrocautery to coagulate the artery.
Endoscopic stapling is used for appendiceal division. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Copious irrigation
is undertaken to ensure removal of all inflammatory debris. Fascial closure is performed at the umbilical site using
Maxon 2-0. The skin is closed with interrupted nylon 4-0. Patient tolerated procedure well.
IV fluids and pain management as per protocol. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.

was identified. The appendix was adhered to surrounding structures. The surrounding tissues showed fluctuating
reaction. No evidence of malignancy. Dissection is carried out to isolate the base of the appendix. The mesoappendix is
divided using a bipolar energy device. Base of appendix secured with purse-string suture prior to removal. Specimen
placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Thorough irrigation of the abdominal cavity is performed, removing all purulent
material. We close the fascia at the umbilical port with figure-of-eight sutures of PDS 2-0 and the skin with interrupted
nylon 4-0.

A 17-year-old non-binary who presented with abdominal pain with fever. Initially evaluated 4 days prior and diagnosed
with mesenteric adenitis. Now has markedly elevated WBC, elevated CRP, no fever. Imaging: ultrasound showing
phlegmonous appendicitis.
Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General anesthesia administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen prepped in sterile
fashion. We create a 1 cm infraumbilical incision and enter the abdomen using the Hasson technique. Single-incision
laparoscopic port is used. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity,
extensive adhesions noted. The surgical field demonstrated necrotic appendix with localized surrounding inflammation.
Purulent fluid was noted throughout the abdominal cavity. Severe adhesions required careful lysis. No bowel injury
noted. Dissection is carried out to isolate the base of the appendix. The mesoappendix is dissected and the appendiceal
artery is controlled with electrocautery. Absorbable ligatures are applied prior to amputation. Specimen placed in
EndoCatch bag for removal. We irrigate the abdominal cavity copiously with warm saline until the effluent is clear. We
close the fascia with PDS 3-0 in a interrupted fashion. Skin is approximated with subcuticular Monocryl 4-0.
Early ambulation and supportive care recommended. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.
