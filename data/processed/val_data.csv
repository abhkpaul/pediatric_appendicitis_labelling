A 4-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain with rebound tenderness. Initially evaluated 2 days prior and
diagnosed with ovarian cyst. Now has markedly elevated WBC, normal CRP, low-grade fever. Imaging: CT scan
showing peri-appendiceal fluid.
Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. Total intravenous anesthesia administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen prepped in
sterile fashion. A vertical infraumbilical incision is made and carried down to the fascia which is incised sharply.
Additional 5 mm trocars are placed in the right and left lower quadrants under laparoscopic guidance. No iatrogenic
injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, minimal adhesions noted. The surgical
field demonstrated perforated appendix with intense surrounding inflammation. A small localized abscess was found and
drained. The appendix was adhered to surrounding structures. Bladder and ureters visualized, no injury. We carefully
dissect the inflammatory mass and identify the acutely inflamed appendix. The appendiceal mesentery is carefully taken
down with harmonic scalpel. We secure the appendiceal base with two Endoloops and transect between them.
Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Thorough irrigation of the abdominal cavity is performed, removing all
purulent material. We close the fascia at the umbilical port with figure-of-eight sutures of PDS 2-0 and the skin with
non-absorbable Prolene 4-0. Ovaries and uterus normal in female patients.
Postoperative imaging if fever persists. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.

Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with mask induction administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We create a 1 cm infraumbilical incision and enter the abdomen using the Hasson technique.
Single-incision laparoscopic port is used. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the
abdominal cavity, significant adhesions noted. The surgical field demonstrated necrotic appendix with diffuse
surrounding inflammation. Abscess cavity found in RLQ and irrigated. No significant adhesions. Dissection is carried out
to isolate the base of the appendix. The appendiceal mesentery is carefully taken down with harmonic scalpel. Base of
appendix secured with purse-string suture prior to removal. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. We irrigate
the abdominal cavity copiously with warm saline until the effluent is clear. Fascial closure is performed at the umbilical
site using PDS 3-0. The skin is closed with non-absorbable Prolene 4-0.
Monitor wound sites for infection. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.

Patient in supine position. General anesthesia and epidural block administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We create a 1 cm infraumbilical incision and enter the abdomen using the Hasson technique.
We place two additional trocars, one in the suprapubic region and one in the left lower quadrant, both under direct
vision. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, diffuse adhesions
noted. Findings include ruptured appendix with localized inflammatory changes. A large pelvic abscess was present and
evacuated. Multiple bowel loops adherent to the mass. Meticulous dissection performed due to distorted anatomy. The
appendiceal mesentery is carefully taken down with harmonic scalpel. The appendix is ligated at its base with two
absorbable sutures and then amputated. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. We irrigate the abdominal
cavity copiously with warm saline until the effluent is clear. We close the fascia at the umbilical port with figure-of-eight
sutures of Vicryl 3-0 and the skin with subcuticular Vicryl 4-0. Minor bleeding controlled with cautery.

sharply. Three trocars in total are used for laparoscopic access. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement.
Upon entering the abdominal cavity, minimal adhesions noted. Findings include suppurative appendix with marked
inflammatory changes. A large pelvic abscess was present and evacuated. Minimal adhesions were noted. Dissection is
carried out to isolate the base of the appendix. The appendiceal mesentery is carefully taken down with harmonic
scalpel. We secure the appendiceal base with two Endoloops and transect between them. Specimen placed in
EndoCatch bag for removal. Irrigation performed with antibiotic solution. We close the fascia at the umbilical port with
figure-of-eight sutures of PDS 3-0 and the skin with Dermabond.

left lower quadrants under laparoscopic guidance. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon
entering the abdominal cavity, diffuse adhesions noted. Operative findings included perforated appendix and mild
inflammation. There was a contained abscess in the right lower quadrant. The appendix was adhered to surrounding
structures. Incidental Meckel's diverticulum found and left in situ. We carefully dissect the inflammatory mass and
identify the ruptured appendix. The mesoappendix is dissected and the appendiceal artery is controlled with
electrocautery. Base of appendix secured with purse-string suture prior to removal. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag
for removal. We lavage the abdomen extensively, paying particular attention to the pelvis and right gutter. We close the
fascia with Vicryl 3-0 in a interrupted fashion. Skin is approximated with non-absorbable Prolene 4-0. No intraoperative

penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. We place two additional trocars, one in the suprapubic region and
one in the left lower quadrant, both under direct vision. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon
entering the abdominal cavity, significant adhesions noted. Appendix appeared distended, surrounded by mild
inflammatory reaction. No abscess, but turbid fluid present. Multiple bowel loops adherent to the mass. No technical
difficulties encountered during surgery. The appendix is mobilized using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection. We
dissect the mesentery of the appendix and use the electrocautery to coagulate the artery. Absorbable ligatures are
applied prior to amputation. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Copious irrigation is undertaken to ensure

Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with regional block administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. A vertical infraumbilical incision is made and carried down to the fascia which is incised
sharply. Three trocars in total are used for laparoscopic access. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement.
Upon entering the abdominal cavity, minimal adhesions noted. The surgical field demonstrated sclerotic appendix with
mild surrounding inflammation. A small localized abscess was found and drained. Dense adhesions were encountered
during dissection. We carefully dissect the inflammatory mass and identify the friable appendix. The mesoappendix is
dissected and the appendiceal artery is controlled with electrocautery. The appendix is ligated at its base with two
absorbable sutures and then amputated. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Thorough irrigation of the
abdominal cavity is performed, removing all purulent material. We close the fascia with PDS 2-0 in a interrupted fashion.
Skin is approximated with Dermabond.
Early ambulation and supportive care recommended. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.

Patient in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. Transverse infraumbilical incision is performed and access gained via blunt dissection. Three
trocars in total are used for laparoscopic access. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering
the abdominal cavity, significant adhesions noted. Intraoperative examination revealed perforated appendix. No
abscess, but turbid fluid present. No significant adhesions. The surrounding tissues showed marked reaction. Meticulous
dissection performed due to distorted anatomy. The mesoappendix is dissected and the appendiceal artery is controlled
with electrocautery. The base of the appendix is healthy and we place three EndoLoops - two proximal and one distal -
before transecting the appendix. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Abdominal lavage performed until
clear. All port sites closed with subcuticular Monocryl 4-0.
Pain control with acetaminophen and morphine as needed. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood
loss.

Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with mask induction administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We create a 1 cm infraumbilical incision and enter the abdomen using the Hasson technique.
We place two additional trocars, one in the suprapubic region and one in the left lower quadrant, both under direct
vision. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, extensive adhesions
noted. Findings include necrotic appendix with localized inflammatory changes. A moderate amount of purulent material
was present in the pelvis. No abnormal adhesions found. The appendix is mobilized using a combination of sharp and
blunt dissection. The mesoappendix is dissected and the appendiceal artery is controlled with electrocautery.
Absorbable ligatures are applied prior to amputation. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. We lavage the
abdomen extensively, paying particular attention to the pelvis and right gutter. We close the fascia at the umbilical port
with figure-of-eight sutures of PDS 2-0 and the skin with subcuticular Monocryl 4-0.
Repeat CBC and CRP postoperatively. Ovaries and uterus normal in female patients. The patient tolerated the
procedure well with minimal blood loss.

diagnosed with urinary tract infection. Now has normal WBC, high CRP, low-grade fever. Imaging: ultrasound
suggestive of appendicitis.
Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General anesthesia administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen prepped in sterile
fashion. Transverse infraumbilical incision is performed and access gained via blunt dissection. We place two additional
trocars, one in the suprapubic region and one in the left lower quadrant, both under direct vision. No iatrogenic injuries
occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, diffuse adhesions noted. The surgical field
demonstrated thick-walled appendix with patchy surrounding inflammation. Multiple small abscesses were encountered.
Severe adhesions required careful lysis. No bowel injury noted. Blunt dissection is used to free the appendix from
surrounding structures. We dissect the mesentery of the appendix and use the electrocautery to coagulate the artery.
Endoscopic stapling is used for appendiceal division. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Thorough
irrigation of the abdominal cavity is performed, removing all purulent material. Fascial closure is performed at the
umbilical site using Maxon 2-0. The skin is closed with subcuticular Vicryl 4-0.
Monitor wound sites for infection. The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.

prepped in sterile fashion. We make an infraumbilical incision of 1 cm, dissect the subcutaneous tissue bluntly and
penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. Additional 5 mm trocars are placed in the right and left lower
quadrants under laparoscopic guidance. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the
abdominal cavity, moderate adhesions noted. The surgical field demonstrated necrotic appendix with fluctuating
surrounding inflammation. No pus or abscess formation found. Severe adhesions required careful lysis. No evidence of
peritoneal carcinomatosis. The appendix is mobilized using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection. The
appendiceal mesentery is carefully taken down with harmonic scalpel. Absorbable ligatures are applied prior to
amputation. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. We irrigate the abdominal cavity copiously with warm
saline until the effluent is clear. We close the fascia with PDS 2-0 in a interrupted fashion. Skin is approximated with
non-absorbable Prolene 4-0.
The patient will be continued on IV antibiotics and advanced to diet as tolerated. The patient tolerated the procedure well
with minimal blood loss.

Procédure(s) opératoire(s) / Operative procedure(s):
Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with caudal block administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We make an infraumbilical incision of 1 cm, dissect the subcutaneous tissue bluntly and
penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. Single-incision laparoscopic port is used. No iatrogenic injuries
occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, significant adhesions noted. Operative findings
included suppurative appendix and patchy inflammation. There was a contained abscess in the right lower quadrant.
The appendix was adhered to surrounding structures. We proceed with careful dissection of the appendiceal
attachments. The mesoappendix is dissected and the appendiceal artery is controlled with electrocautery. We secure
the appendiceal base with two Endoloops and transect between them. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal.
Abdominal lavage performed until clear. Umbilical port site is closed with PDS 3-0 and skin with Steri-Strips.
The patient will be continued on IV antibiotics and advanced to diet as tolerated. The patient tolerated the procedure well

sterile fashion. We make an infraumbilical incision of 1 cm, dissect the subcutaneous tissue bluntly and penetrate the
abdominal cavity via an open technique. Three trocars in total are used for laparoscopic access. No iatrogenic injuries
occurred during trocar placement. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, extensive adhesions noted. Appendix appeared
gangrenous, surrounded by persistent inflammatory reaction. No pus or abscess formation found. Dense adhesions
were encountered during dissection. We carefully dissect the inflammatory mass and identify the ruptured appendix. The
mesoappendix is divided using a bipolar energy device. We secure the appendiceal base with two Endoloops and
transect between them. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Copious irrigation is undertaken to ensure
removal of all inflammatory debris. All port sites closed with Dermabond. Minimal intraoperative blood loss.

Patient in supine position. General anesthesia with nitrous oxide administered. Time-out was performed and abdomen
prepped in sterile fashion. We make an infraumbilical incision of 1 cm, dissect the subcutaneous tissue bluntly and
penetrate the abdominal cavity via an open technique. We place two additional trocars, one in the suprapubic region and
one in the left lower quadrant, both under direct vision. No iatrogenic injuries occurred during trocar placement. Upon
entering the abdominal cavity, moderate adhesions noted. Intraoperative examination revealed phlegmonous appendix.
A small localized abscess was found and drained. The appendix was adhered to surrounding structures. The
surrounding tissues showed extensive reaction. Blunt dissection is used to free the appendix from surrounding
structures. Mesenteric vessels to the appendix are secured prior to removal. The appendix is ligated at its base with two
absorbable sutures and then amputated. Specimen placed in EndoCatch bag for removal. Irrigation performed with
antibiotic solution. All port sites closed with Dermabond.
